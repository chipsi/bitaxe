# Bitaxe JLCPCB production files
Use following instructions to order partially assembled board from JLCPCB.

JLCPCB files are prepared to only assemble TOP side!

## Instructions:

- Use [jlcpcb_bom_top.xlsx] and [jlcpcb_cpl_top.xlsx] to order assembly.
- Order rest of non solderet parts from [pending_bom_top_bot.xlsx]

## Why not to order full assembly board?
- This was chosen to minimize board cost
- There are some components that still need to be soldered by hand because of JLCPCB stock right now
- You can try ordering full board if you want.
